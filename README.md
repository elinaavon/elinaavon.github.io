I created a telegram bot for an imaginary jewelry store called Club de fresas. Although the project currently has limited functionality, it has big room for development to serve as a an excellent customer support and business optimization tool for a yet to be developed jewelry store website.
There are more other features that I am planning to do in the future, such as ordering and paying, tracking orders, and a whole website for the jewelry store.
**The bot can be found in Telegram @clubdefresas.**
I described the bot's functionality with screenshots here https://www.notion.so/Club-de-fresas-Telegram-Bot-for-A-Jewelry-store-e2d37f90bba84960b4eca5bef865cd3b?pvs=4
